<h1 align="center"> Joint Analysis of Copy Number from Exomes (JACNEx) Pipeline (Archived)</h1>

**This version of the JACNEx pipeline is now archived** due to the conclusion of the associated thesis work. 
However, development **continues actively** through a fork, which is now maintained in a new GitHub repository: [https://github.com/ntm/JACNEx](https://github.com/ntm/JACNEx).

For any new issues or feature requests, **please first verify** if it has already been implemented or discussed in the new repository.
If not, you can submit any new issues directly on the new JACNEx repository.
